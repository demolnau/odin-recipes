# odin-recipes

This is a brief practice project for the Odin Project Intro to HTML course. 
Instructions can be referenced here : https://www.theodinproject.com/paths/foundations/courses/foundations/lessons/recipes

This is a project focused on adding links and images, as well as, creating ordered and unordered lists. You will notice that there is an image that is downloaded for the sake of using a local link as well. The recipe folder will contain 3 recipes: Lasagna, Orange Chicken and White Bean Soup.
